### 🔐 One place for it all.
No more need to remember different accounts for your multiplayer Scratch projects. CLΩ is a simple but flexible identity provider for networked Scratch projects.

### 🎮 Built for gaming.
CLΩ is built for online gaming. Combined with the powerful CL5 protocol and a powerful arsenal of tools at your disposal, you'll never look back at other third party services.

### 🧭 Stress-free, programmable matchmaking.
You won't get PWN'd by someone who's 50 times your level, nor will you get stuck with a low-level player again. By comparing your playtime and experience with other players via Optimal Matching, CLΩ garantees fair and friendly competition. Matchmaking functionality is also highly programmable.

### 💾 Save it all.
CLΩ provides free cloud save functionality for all Scratch projects. Store up to 10 save slots per game, each containing up to 10 KB of data.

### 🪙 Play and win.
No more need to grind one game to earn points. CLΩ provides a standardized points system that can be earned via in-game achivements, activities, events, etc. and can be spent in any other game where CLΩ is supported.

### 🛡️ Privacy-respecting. 
CLΩ never collects any PII without your permission. And, the only data CLΩ collects is a username, a password, and a suitable email address for login. Other than games, achivements, saves and points, there's no hidden black magic behind the scenes.

### 🗝️ Secure.
Using perfect forward secrecy, CLΩ servers will never be able to capture or read data you send/receive while playing a game, nor can it read the raw contents of CL5's WebRTC handshake process.

### 🚀 Extremely fast.
CL5, the building block of CLΩ, is Scratch 3's first WebRTC implementation, built from the ground-up. Lightning fast and easy to use.

### 🪶 Lightweight.
CL5 provides the most networking functionality of any Scratch extension, without extra requirements.

### 🔃 Lots of data at any time.
Built on top of WebRTC, CL5 supports *up to* 65,534 simultaneous data channels per connected peer. **That's a lot of data!**

### ⚙️ Configurable.
Want messages to be guaranteed reliable? CL5's got you covered. Have a need for speed? Simply change to unordered mode.

### 🌐 Peer-to-peer, simplified.
No need for a single server like CL4 and older. CL5 only needs a Raspberry Pi to host a signaling backend to get the fun going.
If needed, you can always implement your own STUN/TURN servers.

# What if I don't want to use CLΩ?
### 👍 Don't worry, that's perfectly fine.
CLΩ and CL5 can be modified to operate independently. You can easily build your own game server and implement your own functionality, all while remaining fully compatible.
